Changes in BigARTM CLI
======================

v0.8.2
------

* added option ``--rand-seed`` to initialize random number generator; without this options, RNG will be set using system time
* added option ``--write-vw-corpus`` to convert batches into plain text file in Vowpal Wabbit format
* change the naming scheme of the batches, saved with ``--save-batches`` option.
  Previously file names were guid-based, while new format will look like this: ``aabcde.batch``.
  New format ensures the ordering of the documents in the collection is be preserved, given that user scans batches alphabetically.
* added switch ``--guid-batch-name`` to enable old naming scheme of batches (guid-based names).
  This option is useful if you launch multiple instances of BigARTM CLI to concurrently generate batches.
* speedup parsing large files in VowpalWabbit format
* when ``--use-modality`` is specified, the batches saved with ``--save-batches`` will only include tokens from these modalities.
  Other tokens will be ignored during parsing. This option is implemented for both VW and UCI BOW formats.

v0.8.0
------

* renamed ``--passes`` into ``--num-collection-passes``
* renamed ``--num-inner-iterations`` into ``--num-document-passes``
* removed ``--model-v06`` option
* removed ``--use-dense-bow`` option

v0.7.x
