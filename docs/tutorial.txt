Tutorial
=========

This tutorial provides a basic Python programmer's introduction to BigARTM.
It demonstrates how to

* install BigARTM library on your computer,
* configure basic BigARTM parameters,
* load the text collection into BigARTM,
* infer topic model and retrieve the results.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

* Download and install Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

* Download and unpack the latest BigARTM release (https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm/releases).
  Choose carefully between win32 and x64 version.
  The version of BigART package must match your version Python installed on your machine.

* Setup *Google Protocol Buffers* library, included in the BigARTM release package.
  To do so, follow the instructions in `protobuf/python/README
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/3rdparty/protobuf/python/README.txt>`_.

The BigARTM package will contain the following files:

  ==================== ==============================================================================================
  ``bin/``             Precompiled binaries of BigARTM for Windows. Two files are particularly important:

                       * The ``bin/artm.dll`` contains the core functionality of the BigARTM library.

                       * The ``bin/node_controller.exe`` is an executable that hosts BigARTM nodes
                         in a distributed setting.

  ``protobuf/``        A minimalistic version of `Google Protocol Buffers
                       <https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>`_
                       library, required to run BigARTM from Python.
                       To setup this package follow the instructions in ``protobuf/python/README`` file.

  ``src/``             Several programming interfaces to BigARTM library.

                       * ``c_interface.h`` -
                         :doc:`low-level BigARTM interface </ref/c_interface>` in plain C.

                       * ``cpp_interface.h``, ``cpp_interface.cc``, ``messages.pb.h`` and ``messages.pb.cc``
                         provide C++ interface of BigARTM (not documented).

                       * ``python_interface.py`` and ``messages_pb2.py`` provide
                         :doc:`Python interface of BigARTM </ref/python_interface>`.

                       * ``messages.proto`` describe all protocol buffer messages that appear in the API of BigaRTM.

  ``artm_example.py``  A script to demonstrate typical usage of BigARTM in Python.

  ``*.kos.txt``        Files ``docword.kos.txt`` and ``vocab.kos.txt`` represent a simple
                       collection of text files in Bag-Of-Words format.
                       The files are taken from `UCI Machine Learning Repository
                       <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words>`_.

  ``LICENSE``          License file of BigARTM.

Installation on Linux
---------------------

Currently there is no distribution package of BigARTM for Linux.
BigARTM had been tested on several Linux OS, and it is known to work well,
but you have to get the source code and compile it locally on your machine.
Please, refer to :doc:`Developer's Guide </devguide>` for further instructions.

First steps
-----------

Run ``artm_example.py`` script from BigARTM distributive. It
will load the text collection from disk, perform 7 scans over
the collection to infer 4 topic models. Then it outputs top
works in each topic and topic classification of 5 random
documents. Running the script produces the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

   >python artm_example.py

   Loading data... Done.
   Iter# = 1, Perplexity = NaN
   Iter# = 2, Perplexity = 6803.63264939
   Iter# = 3, Perplexity = 2538.98778912
   Iter# = 4, Perplexity = 2482.95994578

ArtmLibrary and MasterComponent
-------------------------------

The following code is typical for every BigARTM application.

.. code-block:: python

    from python_interface import *
    os.environ['PATH'] = ';'.join([os.path.abspath(os.curdir) + '\\BigARTM', os.environ['PATH']])
    library = ArtmLibrary(os.path.abspath(os.curdir) + '\\BigARTM\\artm.dll')

    with library.CreateMasterComponent() as master:
      # Use master

Most of BigARTM is implemented in C++, and exposed in single
binary ``artm.dll`` (or ``artm.so`` if you are on Linux).
Python module ``ArtmLibrary`` is simply a wrapper around
``artm.dll`` that enables you to access its methods from
Python. When you create ArtmLibrary you have to specify the
location of ``artm.dll`` and make sure that this location is
added to ``PATH``.

Basic configuration
-------------------

The configuration of BigARTM library happens through the
``MasterComponent``. To pass the configuration you use
configuration object
:py:class:`messages_pb2.MasterComponentConfig` and several
methods of :py:class:`python_interface.MasterComponent`.

.. code-block:: python

  # Setup basic configuration
  master_config = master.config()
  master_config.processors_count = 2
  master_config.cache_theta = 1
  master.Reconfigure(master_config)

  # Configure a perplexity score calculator
  master.CreateScore(
    'perplexity_score',
    ScoreConfig_Type_Perplexity,
    messages_pb2.PerplexityScore())

  # Configure the model
  model_config = messages_pb2.ModelConfig()
  model_config.topics_count = 4
  model_config.inner_iterations_count = 10
  model_config.score_name.append("perplexity_score")
  model = master.CreateModel(model_config)
