Basic BigARTM tutorial for Linux and Mac OS-X users
===================================================

Currently there is no distribution package of BigARTM for Linux.
BigARTM had been tested on several Linux OS, and it is known to work well,
but you have to get the source code and compile it locally on your machine.
Please, refer to :doc:`Developer's Guide </devguide>` for further instructions.

To get a live usage example of BigARTM you may check BigARTM's
`.travis.yml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigartm/bigartm/master/.travis.yml>`_
script and the latest `continuous integration build
<https://travis-ci.org/bigartm/bigartm>`_.
